## Projects

Here are some of the projects I've worked on:

1. **QuickChat : A Secure and End To End Encrypted Messaging Platform**
   - Description:
     
  The QuickChat is a secure and private messaging platform that uses the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) to protect all messages exchanged between users. This app offers users the ability to communicate with each other in a secure and confidential manner, ensuring that their conversations remain private and cannot be accessed by anyone else.
  When a user sends a message through this app, the message is first encrypted using AES encryption. This encryption ensures that the message is scrambled and unreadable to anyone who intercepts it. Only the intended recipient of the message has the key to decrypt the message and read it.
  The AES encryption used by this app is considered one of the most secure and trusted encryption methods available today. It uses a symmetric key algorithm that ensures that both the sender and receiver of a message use the same key to encrypt and decrypt messages.
  Overall, this app is an excellent choice for anyone who values privacy and security and wants to communicate with others without the risk of their messages being intercepted or accessed by unauthorized parties. With AES encryption and other security features, this app provides peace of mind to its users and allows them to communicate in a truly private and secure way.
